```

## Features

- **Mixed formats**: You can mix different formats in the same file
- **Whitespace**: Extra spaces around numbers are ignored

## Usage Examples

### Using file only

```bash
registry-cli export graduating-students --file student_numbers.txt
```

### Using file with short alias

```bash
registry-cli export graduating-students -f student_numbers.txt
```

### Combining file and command line arguments

```bash
registry-cli export graduating-students --file student_numbers.txt 901888888 901999999
```

## Creating the File

You can create the file using any text editor:

### Windows Notepad

1. Open Notepad
2. Type or paste the student numbers (one per line or comma-separated)
3. Save as `student_numbers.txt`

### Excel Export

1. Put student numbers in column A of Excel
2. Save As â†’ Text (Tab delimited) or CSV
3. The exported file will work with this command

### From Database Query

If you have student numbers from a database query, you can export them directly to a text file.

## Error Handling

The command will show helpful error messages if:

- The file doesn't exist
- The file contains invalid student numbers
- The file cannot be read

Example error:
